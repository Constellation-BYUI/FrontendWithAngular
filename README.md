# FrontendWithAngular

NOTE: After cloning this repo, make sure to navigate into the 'frontend' folder and execute this command in your terminal 'npm install'

REASON:
because node_modules folder is pretty large, it has been added to the 'gitignor' file, hence it will not be sent or committed to the git repo.
